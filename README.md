# Data analysis for "Evaluating Game-Based Learning Against the Traditional Lecture in Teaching Basics of AI"

This repository contains the data analysis code for my integrated master's research project, which evaluates the efficacy of game-based learning methods in teaching machine learning principles. The project aims to assess how gamification can enhance engagement and knowledge retention among learners.
